# sample-generator

A python project for generating pseudo-random sample data for a wide array of different data formats. It has been setup as a python refresher project, while also providing some purpose to other projects I do that require sample data.

The plan for this project is to be a living repository, whenever I require a new type of sample data, I will create new features to facilitate this.

## Development

A full development explanation will be provided further into this project.

The project can be ran from the main.py file using the following command:

```
python3 src/main.py
```

### Testing

A testing overview will be provided when a testing framework has been selected.
